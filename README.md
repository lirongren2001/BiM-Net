<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

we introduce WM-GM connectivity into FCNs and propose a Bipartite White-Gray Matter Graph Network (BiM-Net).

Our framework models the whole-brain structure as a bipartite graph, with GM and WM regions as distinct node domains connected by their functional connectivities.
